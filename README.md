Project Lead: Ryan James  
Scrum Master: Aaron Spafford  
Developers: Kevin Aujla, Renan Deswarte, Alex Kim


## Summary

GāME is a quick, easy way to find sports sites near you. After automatically locating your position or entering a custom address in the auto-fill search box, you can select from a variety of sports and view the sites closest to you. Click each site or marker to view more information about the site, and checkin to the site as well. Login via Facebook to store your favorite sports, sites, and checkins. And the site is fully functional on mobile as well!


## Local Deployment
Checkout project from github: https://github.com/unbalancedparens/greenfield

Build site locally:

* npm install
* bower install
* grunt build
* grunt shell [opens app in chrome, and watches for updated files]

## Setup Google Maps and Facebook APIs
In [google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com), under **API and auth**, select **Credentials**. In the list of apps, select the app name. Under **Accept requests from these HTTP referrers**, add your development URI (http://localhost:8000) and deployment URI.

In [https://developers.facebook.com](facebook developers dashboard), under **My Apps**, select the app name. Under **Basic**, the App Id and App Secret must match what's in router.js. Next, click **Settings** and then **Advanced**. Under **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**, add your development and deployment URIs.

## Database
The database is hosted on [mongolab](https://mongolab.com/). The DB connection is made in server.js, and the schema for 'users' and 'sites' is in server/models.

## Deployment to Digital Ocean
* On digital ocean, create doplet using Dokku image (Dokku v0.4.3 on 14.04). 
* SSH into d.o. server to create dokku app `dokku apps:create greenfield`. 
* In local repo add a remote that points to this app `git remote add dokku dokku@104.236.108.223:greenfield`. 
* Now from your local repo you can push a new deployment `git push dokku master`. Dokku should run through the build steps automatically and deploy the app:  
`=====> Application deployed:`  
`http://104.236.108.223:32780 (container)`

## Future Features
* A calendar to store future checkins for each site, allowing for scheduling of future meetups.
* More site info, including photos. This could be displayed within the same view, or in a different view.
* User profile pages, with additional user information including favorite sites, sports, and friends.
* Social features and integration, using Facebook and Twitter to enable more social interaction. This could also include chat functionality or a forum for each site/sport.
* Twilio integration for alerts / notifications about upcoming checkins and social features.
* Mobile-specific site design.
